# The Most Efficient MLB Players by Salary ‚Äî 2001 Season

## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes Major League Baseball (MLB) player performance during the 2001 season to identify **the most efficient players per dollar spent**. By comparing **Home Runs (HR)**, **Hits (H)**, and **Runs Batted In (RBI)** relative to player salary, I was able to uncover hidden value‚Äîplayers who significantly outperformed their contracts.

## üìä Metrics Defined

Efficiency was calculated for each of the following:

- **HR Efficiency** = (HR / Salary) * 100,000
- **Hits Efficiency** = (Hits / Salary) * 100,000
- **RBI Efficiency** = (RBI / Salary) * 100,000

Only the **top 50** performers by efficiency in each category were retained. Then, using SQL, I **intersected all three rankings** to identify the **most consistently efficient players** across all offensive metrics.

## üèÜ Key Insight

> üî• **Albert Pujols** was the single most efficient player in the MLB for 2001.

Despite earning only **$200,000**, Pujols posted:
- **37 Home Runs**
- **194 Hits**
- **130 RBIs**

His performance dominated all three metrics **relative to salary**, making him a clear outlier and massive ROI for the Cardinals.

## üß† Tools Used

- **SQL** (MySQL)
- **Tableau** (for data visualization)
- **CS50 Moneyball Dataset**

## üìå Takeaways

- Combining performance metrics with salary data reveals deeper insights than totals alone.
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and `JOIN`s are powerful for layered filtering.
- ROI-based metrics are critical in real-world business and sports analytics.
